# 🌟 WELCOME! 🌟

Hey there! 👋  
You've just landed on my **4th practice** from the subject **`Entornos de Desarrollo`** 🚀

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Here’s how everything is organized 🗂️:

- 📦 **`src/`** → Source code lives here ✨
- 📚 **`lib/`** → Dependencies and libraries go here 🧩
- ⚙️ **`bin/`** → Compiled output files appear here automatically 🧠

---

## 💡 What's This Project About?

This project is all about diving deeper into **Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 💻☕

🏛️ The theme? **A Library System**!  
You’ll find:

- 📖 **Books**
- 🧍 **People**
- 🏠 **Rooms**

Each class includes its own methods (beyond the usual getters & setters) so you can explore how OOP concepts come to life — **for example: polymorphism** 🔁✨

---

🧠 **Goal:** Strengthen my Java skills and understand how to structure real-world applications using OOP principles.
